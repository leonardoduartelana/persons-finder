# Welcome

This is a start-up Git repo for a project we are calling 'Persons finder'.

Your job is to create a set of API's that will feed a mobile application that has one purpose: find people around you.

Requirements:
- POST API to create a 'person'
- PUT API to update/create someone's location using latitude and longitude
- GET API to retrieve people around query location with a radius in KM, Use query param for radius. Extra challenge: Return list ordered by distance to each person.
- GET API to retrieve a person or persons name using their ids
- Responses must follow a JSON format

You'll also need to build the logic and services for saving/retrieving locations and persons.

Steps:
- Clone the project
- Implement required API's and services
- Push your project to your personal github


### Extra challenge
### Add a million, 10 million and 100 million entries and challenge your API's efficiency
